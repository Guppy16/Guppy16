### Hi there 👋

Akash here! Currently in my Final Year studying Information and Computer Engineering at the University of Cambridge (MEng).

In a nutshell, I'm enthusiastic to transform designs from ideas into a reality. 

SKILLS: Python | Machine Learning | C/C++

- ⚡ I'm currently developing an [API](https://github.com/Guppy16/pico-dshot) on the Pi Pico to send DSHOT commands to a drone ESC and motor
- 📚 Checkout my [notes and exercises using PyTorch](https://github.com/Guppy16/NNs-and-Deep-Learning) for the NN and Deep Learning [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
