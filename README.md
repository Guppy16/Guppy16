### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Akash here! Currently in my Masters Final Year studying Information and Computer Engineering at the University of Cambridge.

In a nutshell, I'm enthusiastic to transform designs from ideas into a reality. 

SKILLS: C++ / Python / Machine Learning

- âš¡ I'm currently developing an [API](https://github.com/Guppy16) on the Pi Pico to send DSHOT commands to a drone ESC and motor
- Checkout my [notes and exercises using PyTorch](https://github.com/Guppy16/NNs-and-Deep-Learning) for the book [NN and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
